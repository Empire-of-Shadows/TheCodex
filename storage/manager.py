"""Concrete DatabaseManager for TheCodex (bot-owned, NOT vendored).

Composes the vendored engine base (``DatabaseManagerBase``) with this bot's two mixins
(``DefineCollections`` + ``DatabaseProperties``) and instantiates the shared ``db_manager``
the rest of the bot imports. The engine stays generic; the bot supplies its collections.

Previously this composition + the ``db_manager`` instance lived at the bottom of
``storage/database_manager.py``; that file is now the vendored engine base, so the concrete
instance moved here. Import sites use ``from storage.manager import db_manager``.
