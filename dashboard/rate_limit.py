"""Lightweight in-process per-IP rate limiting for public/auth endpoints.

Fixed-window counter, no external dependency. Sufficient for a single-worker
uvicorn deployment. If the dashboard is ever scaled to multiple workers or
hosts, swap the in-memory store for a shared one (Redis/Mongo).

Only a small set of unauthenticated, internet-facing routes are limited; the
authenticated API is already gated by session auth and the bot-token Discord
calls are token-bucketed elsewhere.
