"""Support-aware on_error for the bot's own Views, LayoutViews and Modals.

An exception that no callback caught otherwise reaches the member only as
Discord's bare "This interaction failed", with nothing telling them where to
report it. These mixins replace discord.py's default ``on_error`` with one that
logs the exception with its traceback (as the default does) and then sends the
member an EPHEMERAL failure message ending with the support-server line.

Put the mixin FIRST in the bases so its ``on_error`` wins:

    class CodexHelpView(SupportAwareViewMixin, ui.LayoutView): ...
    class SomeModal(SupportAwareModalMixin, discord.ui.Modal): ...

Factory-built interactive layouts use ``SupportAwareLayoutView`` in place of a
bare ``ui.LayoutView()`` (``SupportAwarePlainView`` in place of a bare
``ui.View()``). A ``DynamicItem`` callback never reaches any view's
``on_error`` (discord.py logs and drops it), so each one calls
``send_unexpected_failure`` from its own ``except``.

Plain module (no ``setup()``), so the cog loader leaves it alone. The admin
panel's seam uses the admin engine's own equivalents (``SupportAwareView``,
``SupportAwareModal``, ``support_aware`` in ``admin/views/base.py``).
